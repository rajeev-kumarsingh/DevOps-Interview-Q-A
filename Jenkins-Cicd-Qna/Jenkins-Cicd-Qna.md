### 5. **What are the key components of a Jenkins Pipeline?**

**Answer:**

- **Pipeline:** Defines the CI/CD process.
- **Stage:** Logical sections like Build, Test, Deploy.
- **Step:** Single task like running a command.
- **Node:** Execution environment (agent).

## Intermediate Level

### 6. **How does Jenkins work?**

**Answer:**

### 7. **What is a Jenkinsfile?**

**Answer:**  
A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline. It can be stored in source control for versioning.

### 8. **How do you trigger Jenkins pipelines?**

**Answer:**

- Manual trigger
- SCM polling (e.g., Git push)
- Webhooks
- Scheduled (CRON)

### 9. **What are Jenkins agents and masters?**

**Answer:**

- **Master:** Manages jobs, schedules builds, and monitors agents.
- **Agent:** Executes build tasks assigned by the master.

### 10. **How do you secure Jenkins?**

**Answer:**

- Enable authentication and authorization
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure Jenkins with HTTPS
- Use credentials securely with Jenkins Credentials plugin

Environment variables are used to define global or job-specific settings like paths, credentials, or custom configuration values.

### 13. **What is the difference between Freestyle and Pipeline jobs in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**

- **Freestyle Jobs:** Basic jobs with limited configuration options.
- **Pipeline Jobs:** Advanced, code-defined workflows supporting complex CI/CD processes.

### 14. **How do you handle failures in Jenkins Pipelines?**

**Answer:**

- Use `try-catch` blocks in scripted pipelines
- Configure post-build actions
- Add notifications for failed builds
- Implement automated rollback mechanisms

### 15. **What is Blue Ocean in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**  
Blue Ocean is a modern user interface for Jenkins, designed to simplify pipeline visualization and management.

## Troubleshooting and Best Practices

### 16. **How do you troubleshoot a failed Jenkins build?**

**Answer:**

- Check build logs for errors
- Verify environment configurations
- Test scripts locally
- Check plugin compatibility

### 17. **What are some Jenkins best practices?**

**Answer:**

- Use Pipeline as Code with Jenkinsfile
- Secure Jenkins with proper access control
- Use agents for scalability
- Regularly update Jenkins and plugins
